This repo hold's a c rewrite of a cipher program that I wrote in high
school. My original code was not easy to follow or understandbale for that
matter. I also am using this to learn more about how the command line
is parsed in C, as well as how to write to files.

Please don't use this for anything important. All it does is reverse the
string, then encrypt said string with a vigerene cipher using a given keyword

I'd like to make it use the message for encryption too.

Currently there are some bugs when trying to decrypt encrypted messages;
I get the wrong result it seems.
